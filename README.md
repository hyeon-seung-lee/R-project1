This project is first project in ITWILL class.
The goal is to visualize floating population data on the map.

I studied and used leaflet package with R. 
I got data from seoul open data https://data.seoul.go.kr/
I used GoogleMap API to got coordinate data to specify the location of each data.
I classified the data following the column names of floating population data 
and 
by using simple calculation, visualized the data on the map.

Detailed description is explained in 프로젝트1이현승.pptx.
